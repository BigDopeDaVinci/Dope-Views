# Dope-Views
I am looking for help developing a Instagram/tiktok like app for video creators. The goal is to allow music video directors (like myself) to be able to upload and monetize their content straight from the comfort of their devices. We will allow peer to peer interactions, accept donations and most importantly deliver product directly to consumer. Youtube seems like a place to draw inspiration from, however, unlike YouTube we will monetize all creators from the moment they upload their first video. Consumers can directly comment and/or donate to their favorite creator. This will also serve as a portfolio of sorts of the content creator. Over time the idea will grow along with everything else. I am seeking help from eager creators like myself to help bring this together. All credit will be given to whomever decides to lend a helping hand. Also, I am coding with Xcode (SwiftUI) and I am running all tests on iPhone 11 and later. My specific device is the iPhone 12 Pro Max. Best wishes and thank you greatly.
